⚡ Project 'Odysseus': AI-Powered Renewable Energy Dispatch Optimizer

AI-based Decision Framework for Demand–Supply Forecasting, Storage Optimization & Dynamic Bidding  
🚀 Designed to align with India’s IEX market and renewable energy integration goals.

🌍 Problem Context

India’s renewable power producers face three major challenges:

⚖️ Demand–Supply mismatch across regions  

🌦️ Weather-driven generation fluctuations (solar & wind)  

🔋 Inefficient utilization of energy storage and transmission assets  

'Odysseus' aims to solve this by combining AI forecasting models with real-time optimization using machine learning and linear programming.

🧪 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

🔹 Step 1 — Data Generation

Creates synthetic data for 5 renewable zones

Variables:
  - solar_irr, wind, temp
  - gen_mw, demand_mw
  - price_inr_per_mwh

5 years of hourly data simulated, sample cut for last 48 hours forecasting.

🔹 Step 2 — Forecasting (Machine Learning)

Uses Gradient Boosting Regressor to learn:
  - Generation = f(solar_irr, wind, temp)
  - Demand = f(hour, day, temp)

Forecast horizon = 48 hours

Predicts:  
  🟢 gen_p50, 🔵 demand_hat, 🟠 price_fc

🔹 Step 3 — Optimization (AI Dispatch)

For each hour and zone:
  - Decides how much to:
    - Serve to demand (retail)
    - Sell to market (IEX)
    - Charge/Discharge battery or hydro
  - Enforces:
    - ⚖️ Energy balance  
    - 🔋 State-of-Charge constraints  
    - 🧾 Reserve margin (5%)  
    - 💸 Market price limits (±20% of IEX)  

Solver: PuLP CBC

🔹 Step 4 — KPI Evaluation

KPI

Formula

Meaning

Reliability

(Energy Served ÷ Forecast Demand)

How much demand was met

Loss%

(Tx + Storage losses ÷ Generation)

Energy lost in process

EBITDA%

(Revenue – Opex) ÷ Revenue

Profitability indicator

🔹 Step 5 — Visualization

🧠 Model Details

Algorithm: Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR)  

Framework: scikit-learn

Input features:
  - hour, dow, temp, solar_irr, wind

Target variables:
  - gen_mw, demand_mw, price_inr_per_mwh

Forecast Horizon: 48 hours  

Output metrics visualized in PNGs and exported to CSVs for analysis.

📈 Visualization Example

Each forecast plot shows:

🟢 P50 (mean prediction) → Most probable trend  

🟡 P10 & P90 bands → Lower & upper uncertainty limits  

🔵 Actual generation/demand overlay for validation  

These visualizations help operators anticipate shortfalls or surpluses, improving bidding and storage decisions.

🧩 Integration with Optimization

Forecasted values (gen_p50, demand_hat, price_fc) feed directly into the linear programming optimizer in odysseus_final_case.py.

This creates a closed-loop decision system that balances:
  - 📊 Forecasting accuracy  
  - ⚡ Operational constraints  
  - 💰 Profit maximization

💡 Pro Tip: You can re-train or extend the forecasting window (e.g. 7 days) by modifying the variable HOURS = 48 in the main script.
